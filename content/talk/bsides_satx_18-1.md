abstract = "With the current standard of companies transitioning to the cloud, digital forensic investigators and incident responders are facing new, unknown territory. As a starting point of talking about cloud DFIR, this talk aims to provide a real-life case study of what it is like to respond to an incident in GSuite, Googleâ€™s cloud business suite. The goal is that by reviewing this case study the audience will not only learn about GSuite DFIR but also begin to think about how this extends to all cloud environments."
